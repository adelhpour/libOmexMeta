done
-----
- modify setAbout methods to auto add model uri if not already have.
- make some fields optional
- Add a hasPart method on PhysicalEntity
- update api to remove "set" everywhere that you can.
	- remember to update the docs on This
- Implement equality operators of LibrdfModel and RDF.
	- Complication: blank nodes cannot be compared when they are read from a string/file because they are given a random ID. Therefore, I implemented my own equality operators which do comparisons whilst ignoring blank identifiers in librdf_statements.
    - Memory problem when comparing models that have statements which use blank nodes. Issue resolved. 
- consolidate "Python" and "english" version of supplementary content into jupyter
