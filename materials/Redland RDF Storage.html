<h1>Redland RDF Storage and Retrieval</h1>

<h2><a name="sec-abstract">Abstract</a></h2>

<p>An overview of the Redland storage and retrieval architecture and
implementation along with the current problems and issues.
</p>


<h2><a name="sec-intro">1. Redland Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Redland was designed and implemented from early 2000 with a
modular approach to the internal parts - each has an interface and a
set of implementations of that interface (details of how to do this
in C and cross-languages are described in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref1">[1]</a>).
The storage architecture similarly abstracted the triple storing
(<a href="http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/docs/api/storage.html"><tt>librdf_storage</tt></a> class in Redland) away
from the user access the RDF graph (<a href="http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/docs/api/model.html"><tt>librdf_model</tt></a>).
</p>


<h2><a name="sec-identity">2. Identity in Redland</a></h2>

<p>In Redland an RDF triple (<a href="http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/docs/api/statement.html"><tt>librdf_statement</tt></a>) and the
three triple terms, subject, predicate and object are nodes
(<a href="http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/docs/api/node.html"><tt>librdf_node</tt></a>) of three types: RDF URI references also known
as resources, blank nodes or literals (including datatyped,
with/without languages).  The nodes are independent of any graph and
carry no other state than their respective identity or (for literals)
strings.</p>

<p>Redland takes advantage of this and <em>interns</em> both nodes
and (RDF) URIs so that triples in the system are three unique
pointers to the node objects.  All nodes and triples are identified
by their content and not attached to any particular graph.  This
allows triples and nodes to be copied by simple reference
counting.  When stored, no other information need be recorded for a
triple.</p>

<p>RDF graphs do not provide any other structure inside the graph
between the triple level and the entire graph; such as sub-graphs
or "quoted" triples.  As will be discussed later
in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#sec-contexts">section 5</a>, Redland introduces
a facility called <em>Redland Contexts</em><a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref4">[4]</a>
to aid with the common task of graph merging and tracking the
original triple/graph sources.</p>


<h2><a name="sec-retrieve">3. Triple retrieval API in Redland</a></h2>

<p>The user API presented in Redland is a triple-based API one where
the triples can be added removed, and searches done by passing in
triples with any of the fields allowed to be omitted.  This is
typically called a <em>"triples matching" query</em> and is a common
metaphor for retrieval seen in many RDF APIs and applications.
Redland does not provide any way to store standalone nodes and arcs,
but navigating the graph that is formed from triples can be done in a
node-centric form by using model methods that return the object of a
triple with a given (subject, predicate), that is, the node at the
end of an arc. such as the pseudo code:</p>
<pre>node=model.get_target(subject, predicate)
</pre>

<p>Retrieval of information from an RDF graph can be in the form of
asking for triples that match a certain value - asking for some parts
of the triples given other parts that are known.  These return RDF
concepts such as triples or nodes.</p>

<p>In relation databases, the SQL language provides retrieval by a
textual query language rather than concepts in software, and the
result are a set of variable bindings.  This more classic query
language style support is not currently directly available in Redland
but underway and in the original design in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref1">[1]</a> as
another software module.  There are many experimental RDF query
languages as discussed in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref10">[10]</a>
but only a few with multiple interoperable implementations
such as Squish<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref9">[9]</a> and RDQL<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref11">[11]</a>
(not a complete list, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref10">[10]</a> for more).
</p>


<h2><a name="sec-store">4. Triple storing in Redland (<tt>librdf_storage</tt> class)</a></h2>
class 
<p>The two store classes that were implemented (and always-present)
were an in-memory store (storage name <tt>"memory"</tt>) and a store
using hashes of key:value (<tt>"hashes"</tt>), another class provided
by Redland internally (<a href="http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/docs/api/hash.html"><tt>librdf_hash</tt></a>).  The Redland <tt>librdf_hash</tt>
class provides key:value maps with duplicate values allowed for a key
(aside: GDBM does not support this, which is why it was dropped, see
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#sec-store-persist">section 4.2</a>).
The duplicate values allows duplicate
triples to be stored, but this is not the primary reason for allowing
them.  They are needed to provide redland contexts, described later
in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#sec-contexts">section 5</a>.
</p>

<p>The current hash implementations are in-memory one based on
a custom hash implementation and a persistent one using
Sleepycat/Berkeley&nbsp;DB<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref">[2]</a> (BDB) or any
other.  This means that an in-memory store, an in-memory indexed
store or a persistent indexed store are all possible.</p>

<p>The in-memory store was designed to be simple to understand so
that its operation was trivially verifiable and formed the basis for
the storage unit tests.  The indexed store was then developed,
providing a more sophisticated storage solution.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#table1">Table 1</a>
shows the current use of hashes, evolved from the indexes
suggested after personal communications with Dan Brickley,
informed by earlier work such as rdfDB<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/ref5">[5]</a>
and earlier projects at the ILRT.  The key piece
of information used was that the disk access is so much slower
than the transfer time or processor time, that it is
more expensive and complex to have multiple hashes, identify
the key and values uniquely and assign short IDs, than to
just store all of the triples in each hash, the approach
taken here.  It is not clear if this balance still applies
several years after the original work.</p>

<p>When a query is done using the triples matching style,
Redland picks the most appropriate hash if it is available.
When it is not, Redland lists all the (key,value) pairs of
one of the hashes that stores all S,P,O and uses the
resulting set of triples to match against.  In this way,
Redland can perform queries when the hash is not available
with no user interaction.  This store model can thus work
with 1 hash only, since the S,P,O are stored in all of
the hashes (1-4).

</div>

<p>The hashes are used both for the statement queries and the node
centric ones.  The former are provided by serialising the hash and
filtering via the querying statement.  This can be very slow for
large models so the node-centric indexes are used when only one of
the elements of the statement is blank.  Node-centric queries mean
querying using the <em>Model</em> relative to a particular resource
node or arc.  The SP2O hash finds outgoing nodes from a resource with
a given arc, the PO2S hash finds incoming nodes with a given arc and
destination and the SO2P hash finds the arcs between two given nodes.
These combinations of indexes have been found to be quite useful in
experiments and testbeds implemented previously at ILRT, without the
need to have full combination of indexes.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#table2">Table 2</a> shows an alternate set of hashes,
which more reflect the use of the triple APIs.  It is more often the
case that nodes and properties are followed "forward", i.e. from
subject and predicate to object, rather than backwards.  The SP2O
hash would indeed be the best candidate for a 1-hash store solution.
As with any choice, this is very application specific, and the P2SO
hash might be critical in performance to some work.

<p>Redland uses a dynamic hash configuration so that different stores
could set up the hashes they want in any combination.  This has not
been exposed to the user api at this point due to the complexity.  It
might be better instead to offer a set of hash indexing choices from
small to large or optimised for certain uses.</p>




<h3>4.1 In-memory stores</h3>

<p>Reviewing what has already been mentioned and outlining the issues
with the current in-memory stores, some further extrapalations can be
made on the possible aproaches for improving the store.</p>

<dl>
<dt>1. Store <tt>"memory"</tt></dt>

<dd><p>This is implemented as a doubly linked list which is very
simple to develop, understand and trivial to verify correctness.
This approach allowed test cases to be built.</p>
<p>Very fast with small models due to simplicity but
O(n) in all searches due to no indexing and inappropriate for
graphs with moderate number sof triples.</p>
</dd>

<dt>2. Store <tt>"hashes"</tt> with hash type <tt>"memory"</tt></dt>
<dd><p>Using in-memory hash types, this provides an indexed and fast
in-memory store.</p>
</dd>

<dt>3. Store <tt>"hashes"</tt> with hash type <tt>"bdb"</tt> and no filename</dt>
<dd><p>BDB has a feature that if no filename is provided for the
persistent store, it will create an in-memory one instead.  This
is possible but has not been tested.
</p></dd>

<dt>Future</dt>
<dd>Use the advantages of the interned triples to provide an
in-memory store that can have a regular memory structure.  It could
even be made memory-mapped to files or possible to fast load.
An in-memory store when in use that was also persistent would
have advantages in certain cases, for <em>hot triples</em>
such as schema information.</dd>

</dl>



<h3><a name="sec-store-persist">4.2 Persistent Stores</a></h3>

<p>The goal of portability for Redland led to the on-disk store being
developed that used either entirely standalone resources or widely
available and stable databases.  The first store based on hashes
for the storing and indexing let the system depend on earlier
work on persistent btree-based storage such as BDB.</p>

<p>BDB is widely available on many systems (Unix, Linux, POSIX,
others) and has a long history, being developed in the early 1990s.
There are four major versions of BDB seen in deployed systems each
with different and slightly incompatible APIs; some of the minor
versions also have APi changes.  This meant a lot of torturous
configuration and options to support but Redland currently can use
BDB from version 2.4 to 4.1 (or later).
</p>

<p>The persistent store using on-disk BDB hashes originally also had
a GNU DBM (GDBM) implementation, but that persistent store proved
inadequate - it both did not support duplicates and was not being
regularly maintained.</p>



<dl>

<dt>1. Store <tt>"hashes"</tt> with BDB: Redland Hashed Indexes</dt>
<dd>As described in
<a name="sec-store">section 4</a> using BDB hashes on-disk.  Generates
very large files since the full triples including full
URIs and literals are in each triple. Limited by disk size
and speed, but simple to index.  Has proved fast enough up
to low millions of triples.</dd>

<dt>2. Store <tt>"3store"</tt>: 3store</dt>
<dd>When 3store<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref3">[3]</a>,<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref6">[6]</a>
triplestore from the AKTs project is available, Redland can use it
via its triple API.  This API is not where most of the 3store
development is currently focused, and it is not from after personal
communications with the developers, if this API will continue to
be maintained.  In particular, the RDF schema development is
less complete for the triple API, compared to the RDQL one.</dd>

<dt>3. Store <tt>"mysql"</tt>: MySQL</dt>
<dd>A new MySQL store has been developed and operated by
Morten Frederiksen and recently added to the main Redland sources,
in CVS, after the 0.9.14 Redland release
</dd>

<dt>Future</dt>
<dd><p>Nothing is currently planned to extend this at present.  The
MySQL schema might be optimised to take advantage of other schema
ideas from the workshop.  It might be worth creating a BDB store that
matched the binary format used by others such as rdflib.</p>

<p>For <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/">SWAD Europe</a>
we have already written in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref7">[7]</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref8">[8]</a>
in detail about other storage systems, APIs and looked at alternate ways
to represent the triples.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>


<h2><a name="sec-contexts">5. Contexts</a></h2>

<p>A facility called <em>Redland Contexts</em><a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref4">[4]</a>
were added to Redland in version
<a href="http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/RELEASE.html#rel0_9_12">0.9.12</a>
for supporting managing using multiple RDF graphs and merging graphs.
The use case was to allow triples to be asserted from multiple sources
(documents) and then during use of the union graph, for the information
returned by the Redland model calls to return some link to the original
source.</p>

<p>This feature was implemented by allowing,when triples are being
added to the graph, for an additional <tt>librdf_node</tt> to be
passed in as another parameter.  This is the <em>context node</em>
and can be retrieved as the result of any redland triple query, by
using a method from the
<a href="http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/docs/api/iterator.html"><tt>librdf_iterator</tt></a>
or <a href="http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/docs/api/stream.html"><tt>librdf_stream</tt></a> objects.</p>

<p>This was as a major update to the Redland internals for the 
<tt>librdf_iterator</tt> and <tt>librdf_stream</tt>
classes and requried changes to all the implemented store SPIs
and implementations.</p>

<p>This feature can be used for a variety of things depending on how
the context nodes are used with the triples.  The following is not an
exhaustive list:</p>

<dl><dt>Enable true graph merging / updating / demerging<br></dt>
<dd>Identify the
subgraphs (sets of triples from particular sources) with context nodes.</dd>

<dt>Statement Identity<br></dt>
<dd>Add each triple with a different context node.
RDF's model does not assign identity to triples.  There is reification
also which might be used with this approach.</dd>

<dt>Statement Provenance<br></dt>
<dd>Use the context node as the subject of
other statements about the statement that is returned.</dd>

<dt>Subgraphs<br></dt>

<dd>Similar to the merging approach but consider
the RDF graph to be a set of graphs and manipulate them as such.
(Aside: Redland is gaining model aggregation to do this explicitly).</dd>

</dl>

<p>Contexts used this way do have a downside in that they cannot
be transfered using the RDF/XML syntax outside Redland to other
systems without extending the syntax.  They are also probably
not the same as N3 Formulae which amongst other things, quotes
the triples in the contexts as not asserted in the containing
graph.  Redland context node information should also be
available by any network API.</p>



<h2><a name="sec-bench">6. Benchmarking</a></h2>

<p>The current applications of Redland have been up to 3.5M triples
using the BerkeleyDB stores on typical desktop PC hardware<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref1">[1]</a>,
with acceptable interactive response, but this is not considered a
large triplestore.  There are no standard data sets that are
typically used across RDF triple stores (possibly the NCI cancer
ontology<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/positions/bristol-1.html#ref12">[12]</a>, but that is rather specialised)
to compare load and query times.</p>


<h2><a name="sec-issues">7. Issues</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Retrieval can be by API, querying, web/network interfaces</li>
<li>Need to consider inferencing or ontology support - should it be added at this level?</li>
