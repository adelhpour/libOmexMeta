[v1.1.14]
- Added error checking in Editor so that inputs that start with new line character throw an error.
  In python it is easy to accidently include the extra \n at start of an xml.
- Added missing methods to pyomexmeta.Editor. These were already implemented in C++, C and the PyOmexMetaAPI
  but they were not included in pyomexmeta.Editor. These methods are:
      - add_creator()
      - add_curator()
      - add_taxon()
      - add_pubmed()
      - add_description()
      - add_date_created()
      - add_parent_model()
- wrap multiplier argument to add_source/add_sink in the int constructor
  so that it'll automatically converts between double and int
